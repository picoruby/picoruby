    <h1>Privacy Policy for Funicular Debugger</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: 2025-12-23</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This privacy policy applies to the Funicular Debugger browser extension (the "Extension").
        The Extension is designed to help developers debug web applications built with the Funicular framework.
        Your privacy is important to us, and this policy is intended to help you understand what data the Extension interacts with.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or any other data from your browser or your Funicular application to any remote server.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Extension Works</h2>
    <p>
        The Funicular Debugger is a development tool that runs entirely on your local machine within your web browser. Its purpose is to inspect the state of a Funicular application, which includes viewing component hierarchies, state, and events.
    </p>
    <p>
        All data accessed by the Extension is read from the browser's local debugging session and is used solely for the purpose of displaying this information to you, the developer, within the browser's own developer tools panel. The data does not leave your browser.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The data accessed by the Extension is used exclusively for providing its core debugging functionality. We do not use this data for any other purpose, such as analytics, advertising, or tracking.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        Since we do not collect or transmit any data, we do not share any data with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        The Funicular Debugger does not use cookies.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
    </p>
